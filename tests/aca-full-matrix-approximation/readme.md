1. Use `../../src/generate_block_cluster_tree` to generate the block cluster tree hierarchy for visualization in Graphviz from the input mesh data `sphere-from-gmsh-fine_hex.msh`.
   ```bash
   ../../src/generate_block_cluster_tree -i sphere-from-gmsh-fine_hex.msh -n 8 -e 2.0
   ```
2. Since the generated puml file is too large, which cannot be directly visualized.
3. Use the following command to extract far field matrix block at a specified level:

   ```bash
   cat sphere-from-gmsh-fine_hex-bct.puml | grep green | grep "Level: 4"
   ```

  The index sets for tau and sigma clusters are as below for exapmle:
  
  ```

  ```
  
  The two index sets will be used to extract a full submatrix block from the full SLP matrix stored in `matrices-assemble-on-cell-pair.dat`, which is generated by the tester `erichsen1996efficient-example2`.
